# Additions
Simple Xamarin Forms app, written for my kid who has a recent interest in additions.

While the app is really basic, the app uses some interesting C#/Xamarin features :
- XAML
- Reusable custom controls
- Binding to custom properties
- Custom events
- Global styling with Application Resources
